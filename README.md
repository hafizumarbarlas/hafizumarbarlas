- 👋 Hi, I’m Hafiz Umar Barlas (MERN Stack developer) @hafizumarbarlas
- 👀 I’m interested in working with Node and React. I have also developed some projects on it but unfortunately, those were for private clients and I can't share any details about them here. But, I am working on some open source module with node and react which will be available soon.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Redux and trying to master it
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source MERN stack project.
